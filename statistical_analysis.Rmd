### Statistical analysis summary

I created a series of box plots to visualize the relationship between each categorical variable and the target variable. It appears that institutions located in the southeast and southwest regions of the United States might have significantly higher minority enrollments. Historically black colleges and universities have much higher minority enrollments as expected, though minority enrollments (as defined as enrollments of black and latino students) appear lower at tribal colleges. There appears to be a possible trend of increasing minority enrollments along with an increasing degree of urbanization of institution location. Institutions with open enrollment appear to enroll more minority students. 

A possible explanation for some of these effects may be the demographics of where minority students tend to be born and raised prior to attending a college or university. For example, if a higher proportion of the population in the souteastern and southwestern United States is of African-American and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and a high proportion of students attend school within their geographic area of origin, this could explain why miniority enrollments are higher in these areas. Similarly, if more urban locations tend to have higher minority populations, this could help account for the higher miniority enrollments at urban institutions. It also makes sense that schools with open enrollment might tend to have a higher proportion of minority students. Minority students may be more likely to have grown up in less affluent neighborhoods with a lower quality of primary education. It has also been indicated in some educational research studies that minority students tend to perform worse on standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT, which are typically used in selective admissions.

I also created a series of scatter plots to visualize the relationship between each numerical variable and the target variable. There appears to be a possible trend for minority enrollments to decline as the cost of tuition increases. This makes sense, as high cost is likely to be a barrier for minority students with limited financial means. There also appears to be a possible trend for minority enrollments to decrease as grant aid increases, which would seem rather counterintuitive if there were not a strong correlation between increased grant aid and increased cost of tuition. An additional scatterplot visualizing the relationship between grant aid, in-state tuition, and minority enrollments clearly confirms the strong relationship between increased grant aid and increased tuition cost.

There also appears to be some possible effects of the other independent variables on minority enrollments, but it is less clear which if any are significant based on just the plots. Some of the independent variables will undoubtedly be removed from the final model. Grant aid is definitely one good candidate for removal, due to its high correlation with in-state tuition and the fact that from a logical perspective, increasing tuition should tend to drive down enrollment numbers but increasing grant aid should not be a barrier in and of itself.
